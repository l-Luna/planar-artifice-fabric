These tears cause strange effects nearby, but are mostly too small to see; creating a tear big enough to see, let alone feel, requires a little prompting, such as by killing a powerful, energy filled monster."

An $(bold)Aura Basin$() can be placed above a beacon to collect its power. When an item is placed inside, the beacon beam is blocked and the item gains charge. Charging a Curiosity yields a Dimensional Singularity, which has a number of applications."
